Plug is a library for developing plugins for Swift applications. By using macros, it allows you to have simple and clean code and still keep the flexibility of a plugin system. You can load, reload and unload plugins at runtime, change the code used between the plugin and the app, and more.

Inspired on TheSwiftDev's [guide for dynamic libraries](https://theswiftdev.com/building-and-loading-dynamic-libraries-at-runtime-in-swift/)

Refer to the [documentation](https://plugswift.netlify.app/documentation/plug/) for more information.
